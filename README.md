ChoicEats Server
=========
The server component for the ChoicEats application.

Development
-----------------

### Database
We are using the `db-migrate` package to maintain our database.  First you will
want to copy the `.env-sample` file named: `.env`.  Fill out the `DB_*` properties
with your local database values.

Next, run:
```
yarn migrate:up
```
to update your database to the current version.

#### Adding a change to the database
To make a change to the scheme, run:
```
yarn migrate:new <migration_name>
```
This will create a new file in `resources/db-migrate/migrations` that you will
have to fill out.  See the [db-migrate docs](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/SQL/)
for more info.


#### Seeder
If you have a brand new database, there is a seeding app to fill in some data.

```
# Build the seeder
node ./node_modules/.bin/babel resources/seed/ --out-dir build/seeder/

# Run it
node ./build/seeder/seeder.js
```

### Server
First, compile the server code:
```
yarn build-server
```

Second, start up the client
```
yarn start
```
ï¿¼
This will listen to file changes and reload the server when
you run `yarn build` again.


### Graphical Interface

After starting your server navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphiql` for
an interactive query runner.

example query
```
{
  recipes {
    name
    author
    ingredients
    instructions
  }
}
```
